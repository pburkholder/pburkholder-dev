### What

Choir and friends party! Between the Messiah and our winter concert, we 
have a lot to celebrate, and it's been a long time since we've had a chance
to. 

Join us for drinks, snacks, basement karaoke (if folks are game for it), firepit (weather permitting), games, andÂ **great company**!

We'll provide snacks, punch (with booze) and non-alcoholic beverages. If you want to bring other snacks or beer, wine, etc., be our guest.
