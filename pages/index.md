  Hi! Iâ€˜m Peter Burkholder, a geophysicist turned DevOp (or maybe DevSecOp). Current and past jobs include: [cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov), [18F](https://18f.gov), [Chef Software](https://cinc.sh), [AARP](https://aarp.org), [NCBI](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), [UCAR/NCAR](https://www.ucar.edu), and others. I like to make pizza, sing, bike (but not all simultaneously). Pronouns: he/him. Blame mine.

A home for Peter Burkholder's blogging. Stay tuned for updates on DevOps, Compliance Automation, Cloud Adoption or anything that catches my interest.
