# DevOps Waffles

In October 2019 I joined the 


After I came home I scoured the Internet for genuine Liege-style waffles and the best recipe I found was Ashlee Marie's Liege Waffle recipe]()


## Recipe: Traditional Belgian Waffles aka Liege Waffles

Prep time: 40 minutes<br>
Cook time: 4 minutes each<br>
Rising and chilling time: 14 hours. I start this by 4 p.m. for waffles at 10 a.m.<br>
* First rise: 90 minutes
* Second rise: 4 hours
* Chilling: 8 hours
Author: Ashlee Marie -- see Authorship note below


### Ingredients
* 1 Tbsp active dry yeast
* 1 tsp granulated sugar
* 3/4 C whole milk, warmed to 110F-115F 
* 2 large eggs, room temperature, lightly beaten
* 4 C bread flour
* 3 Tbsp packed light brown sugar
* 1 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 C butter, softened (you'll need this after the 90m rise, so can start prep with chilled butter)
* 2 Tbsp honey
* 1 Tbsp vanilla
* 1 1/2 C (8 oz) Belgian pearl sugar


### Instructions

1. Place yeast, sugar and milk into your mixer and proof yeast 5-10 minutes.
1. Add egg and 1 1/2 C of the flour, mix until it's smooth.
1. Sprinkle remaining 2 1/2 C flour over the mixture, to keep the dough from getting crusty. Cover the bowl and let rise 90 minutes.
1. Add brown sugar and salt, and blend on low to medium-low speed. While mixing add the honey and vanilla.
1. Add butter 2 Tbsp at a time.
1. Mix 4 minutes at medium-low speed, let the dough rest for 1 minute, and then continue to mix for 2 minutes, then rest. Repeat until the dough balls up on the hook.
1. Cover and let rise for 4 hours.
1. Knock the dough down, wrap the dough in plastic wrap, 2-3 times around.
1. Place the dough in a bowl or pan, cover, and weigh it down a bit and refrigerate overnight.
1. The next day, place the cold dough (it will be quite firm) on a slightly floured surface and in ALL the Belgian sugar, a little bit at a time.
1. Once mixed, divide the dough in 12 pieces of equal size.
1. Squeeze each chunk into a ball and let it rise for 90 minutes.
1. Cook in a waffle iron for about 4 minutes at 360 F (**do not let iron exceed 375 F**)
1. Let each waffle cool for a few minutes so the sugar glaze hardens. 

Serve as-is, or with whipped cream and fruit. They're very sweet so no syrup needed.

**Cleaning note:** Keep the waffle iron warm until you can clean it. The carmelized remains are hard to clean once they harden.
